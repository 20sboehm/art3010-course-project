                <h1>1 - Introduction: The Art of Color in Web Design</h1>
                <p>
                    Color is critical in web design. It influences user perception, emotions, and behavior. It helps to create a visually 
                    appealing and intuitive experience, enhances usability, and conveys the brand identity of a website. In this web article, 
                    we'll discuss several facets of color in web design and why they're important.

                <h1>2 - Color Psychology: A Palette of Emotions</h1>
                <p>
                    Colors have a remarkable abilitiy to tap into our emotions. Hues such as green and blue can create a feeling of calmness 
                    and tranquility, while colors like red and orange may elicit feelings of passion and energy. Understanding common emotional 
                    responses to certain colors gives a designer the ability to use color with more intentionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To demonstrate this, let's take a look at some examples. This first image is of a website providing legal assistance. Notice the
                    cool blue shades being used here.
                </p>
                <img src="images/legal-blue.PNG" alt="A legal website with a blue color palette." class="legal-img">
                <p>
                    Now, here is the same website but recolored to be red instead of blue.
                </p>
                <img src="images/legal-red.PNG" alt="A legal website with a blue color palette." class="legal-img">
                <p>
                    Which color palette do you prefer? If you were seeking legal assistance, which example would give you greater confidence that this 
                    organization is capable of providing you with the help you need? There is no right answer; your response is your own. However, I would
                    guess that you prefer the original color palette (blues). The red example personally makes me feel uneasy, especially
                    in the context of a legal website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The color palette of a website can strongly influence user's perception of a brand or how they interact with the website's content.
                    Credibility, trust, and brand identity are all supported by a strategic usage color. A good color scheme aids in guiding the user 
                    through their experience on the website, while a bad color scheme creates confusion and may otherwise hinder a positive user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, color psychology is not an exact science. Emotional responses to colors will vary from person to person, and
                    between cultures especially. An example would be the color white, which often symbolizes purity in the west, but in some eastern cultures
                    symbolizes death and grieving. Cultural associations with color are important to keep in mind for a website that has an international audience.
